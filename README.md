# ESP32_Pet_ActivityTracker
Built a low-power dog activity tracker using ESP32-S3, a simulated IMU sensor, and a pretrained TensorFlow Lite model for classifying activities. Implemented NTP-based timestamping, local data logging with LittleFS, and power-saving features like wake-on-motion and deep sleep.
